House Price Prediction

Welcome to the House Price Prediction repository! This project is aimed at predicting the prices of houses based on various features using machine learning models. The dataset used for this project contains information on various properties and their attributes, which are used to train and evaluate the models.

The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately predict house prices based on a variety of features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide a reliable tool for real estate professionals and home buyers.
